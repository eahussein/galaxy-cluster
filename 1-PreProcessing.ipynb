    "The data [GalaxyMNIST](https://github.com/mwalmsley/galaxy_mnist) contains 10,000 images of galaxies (either 3x64x64 or 3x224x224), labelled by Galaxy Zoo volunteers as belonging to one of four morphology classes, where the classes are:\n",

    "0. smooth and round\n",
    "1. smooth and cigar-shaped\n",
    "2. edge-on-disk\n",
    "3. unbarred spiral\n",
    "\n",
    "The galaxies are selected from `Galaxy Zoo DECaLS Campaign` A (GZD-A). The images are shown to volunteers on Galaxy Zoo for them to classify. For each image, at least 17 people were asked the necessary questions, and at least half of them must have answered with the given class. The class labels are, therefore, much more confident than, for example, simply labelling with the most common answer to some question. For more info, visit this [link](https://github.com/mwalmsley/galaxy_mnist)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Labelling data is a big topic in machine learning. Labelled data allow us to use supervised machine learning tools to train on labelled data and classify unlabeled ones. However, labelling data can be costly. Scientists have been trying to figure out a way to label data, but the easiest is that we can depend on human knowledge to label data like the `Galaxy Zoo DECaLS Campaign`.  However, unlabeled data can also be of some benefit if analyzed with the right tools, like unsupervised machine learning. Those tools allow us to explore (find patterns) and cluster the data, leading to discoveries in the data.\n"

For each of these functions, there are many alternative algorithms. \n",

In theory, we can feed the raw data into the autoencoder without any preprocessing. However, in practice this greatly increases the computation time required. In this tutorial series we need to train the models in a reasonable time so that we can bring the idea across. The issue is especially important because optimal use of raw data requires hyperparameter tuning, which is even more time consuming.\n",
